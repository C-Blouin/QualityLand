# QualityLand Book Application

## Why I Built the Application
I built this website application to provide users with a well-documented overview of the renowned book QualityLand. The application utilizes various bootstrap components to support the book contents to offer users a meaningful digital experience without feeling overwhelmed by content.

## Design & Technologies Used
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application layout is responsive and was built with various devices in mind since the content will dynamically adjust based on the device viewport.
